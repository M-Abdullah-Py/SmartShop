# E-commerce SmartShop

## Description
This e-commerce platform allows users to browse and purchase products, focusing on smartphones and their variations in size, color, and specifications. It features product search, detailed product pages with images and reviews, and a seamless "add to cart" system.

## E-Commerce Project Overview

### 1. Product Detail Page
- **Product Display:**
  - The product detail page showcases a large product image (with support for multiple images).
  - It features the product name, price, key features such as color, size, stock availability, and a brief description.
  - The layout is built using flexbox for a clean and responsive design, where the product image and details are on the left, and key features and reviews are on the right.
  
- **Responsive Design:**
  - The page layout adapts to smaller screens (like mobile devices) by stacking the product image and details vertically.

### 2. Product Reviews
- **Review Submission:**
  - Customers can submit reviews for the product, using a form provided directly on the product detail page.
  - The review form includes a text area where customers can leave feedback about the product.
  - Reviews are stored and displayed dynamically beneath the product details.
  
- **Review Display:**
  - All reviews for the product are shown in a structured, card-based layout.
  - Each review includes the reviewer's name, the content of the review, and the timestamp (e.g., "2 hours ago"), using Django's naturaltime filter for relative time formatting.

### 3. Order Tracking
- **Order Tracking Form:**
  - Customers can input their Order ID to track their orderâ€™s status.
  - Upon submission, the system retrieves and displays the order's items and the current order status.
  
- **Order Items Display:**
  - The order details show a list of all purchased items, including:
    - Product images (with a fallback image if no product image is available).
    - Product name and quantity.
  
- **Order Status Updates:**
  - If there are updates to the order (e.g., "Shipped", "Out for delivery"), they are displayed with a description and date.
  - Each status update is styled with a badge showing the date of the update.

### 4. Search Results Page
- **Product Search Results:**
  - When a search query is submitted, the page displays a grid of products matching the search term.
  - Each product card includes:
    - A product image.
    - The product name and price.
    - An "Add To Cart" button (for authenticated users) or a "Login to add the item" prompt (for unauthenticated users).

- **Responsive Layout:**
  - The search results page adjusts to different screen sizes to ensure a seamless browsing experience on mobile and desktop.

### 5. User Authentication Integration
- **Conditional Display:**
  - The system detects whether the user is logged in or not:
    - If logged in, the user can interact with the Add To Cart functionality directly from the product or search pages.
    - If not logged in, users are prompted to log in to add products to their cart.

### 6. Key Features Section
- **Product Key Features:**
  - Each product has a key features section displaying information like:
    - Color: The available color for the product.
    - Size: The size of the product.
    - Stock: Number of units available.
    - Description: A brief overview of the product's features.

- **Styled Layout:**
  - The key features section is styled with a clean, modern look using a light background, padding, and subtle shadowing to make it stand out from the rest of the page.

### 7. Dynamic Cart Integration
- **AJAX-Based Cart Updates:**
  - The "Add To Cart" button uses AJAX to add items to the cart without reloading the page, providing a smoother user experience.
  - The button dynamically sends product information (data-product and data-action) to the server, which processes the cart update.

## Core Models
- **Product Model:**
  - Stores essential product information, including:
    - Name
    - Price
    - Color
    - Size
    - Stock
    - Description
    - Images: Each product can have multiple images associated with it.

- **Cart Model:**
  - The Cart is linked to the user, allowing each user to maintain their own list of items.
  - It stores the relationship between the user and the products they intend to purchase.

- **CartProduct Model:**
  - Tracks individual items added to the cart and their associated quantity.
  - Each item in the cart links to a specific product variation (e.g., a red phone in the 128GB size).

- **Order and OrderItem Models:**
  - Order: Represents the finalized purchase, storing customer details, order status, and payment information.
  - OrderItem: Each product purchased within an order, along with its specific variation and quantity.

- **Review Model:**
  - Stores customer reviews for products, including:
    - Customer: The user who left the review.
    - Content: The body of the review.
    - Timestamp: The time when the review was posted.
